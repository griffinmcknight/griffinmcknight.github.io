## About Me

My name is Griffin McKnight and I am a lifelong learner excited to share my journey into the world of artificial intelligence, machine learning, mathematics, and STEM theory with you. I want to use this space to archive computational conecpts, ideas, and theories for myself and the community.

## Objectives

This blog is not just a collection of topical articles; it's a platform for sharing what I am learning, thinking about, and actively working on with those around me. I hope to inspire others to explore the fields of data science and mathematics by showcasing thought-provoking material and contribute to the ever-evolving world of technology.

## More to Come

Thank you for joining me on this journey and I look forward to sharing more with you!

Griffin McKnight
