My name is Griffin McKnight, and I am currently a graduate research assistant for 
Dr. Balakrishna Gokaraju at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, 
where I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Computational Data Science and Engineering. 
I have a particular interest in researching novel data preprocessing and representation 
techniques to enhance machine learning model performance. My expertise encompasses 
applied machine learning, deep learning, and AI across a wide range of problems.

Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy making things and exploring the outdoors. 
I am passionate about 3D printing and CAD design, nature photography, as well as 
woodworking and bushcraft. I often forage for wild foods and materials, like red cedar, wild 
clay, mushrooms, and berries. I love spending time outdoors, whether it's hiking, camping, 
or practicing outdoor survival skills.

In addition to my tinkering and outdoor hobbies, I enjoy cooking, gardening, and speding 
quality time with my wife. I also love training and playing with my dog, making the most 
of every moment together.
